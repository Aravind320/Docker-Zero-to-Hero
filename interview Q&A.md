1. What is Docker?
Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containers.

2. What is difference between Containers and VM's ?
---Containers as very lightweight in nature because they don't have complete OS where it has very minimal system dependencies that required to run the application.
--In VM's we have full-fledged OS and hypervisor, making them heavier. VM's are less portable in nature. VM's have high level of security and can be isolated from host and other VM's.
